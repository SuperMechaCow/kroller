Each Reanimation Protocol roll of 5+ is put into a pool. A Reanimation Protocol roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.<br><br>If the number of dice in that pool is greater than or equal to the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models, select one of those models to be Reanimated.

Any models that did not Reanimate fail to reassemble, and any dice remaining in the pool are discarded.<br><br><i><b>Example</b>: In the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>, an enemy unit targets and makes its attacks against a 5-strong unit of <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/necrons/Lychguard">Lychguard</a>, destroying 3 models and leaving another with only one wound left. The Lychguard units reanimation protocols are enacted, and you now make Reanimation Protocol rolls for it. Each Lychguard has a Wounds characteristic of 2, so you would roll a total of six D6s. If you rolled 1, 3, 4, 5, 5 and 6, you would put three dice into a pool. This pool contains enough dice to Reanimate one of the destroyed models, and so it is set back up on the battlefield. After that model has been Reanimated, there is only one dice remaining in your pool. This is not enough to Reanimate another reassembling Lychguard model, as it is less than the models Wounds characteristic; this dice is therefore discarded.</i>|

To do so, select one or more of the dice from your Miracle dice pool, instead of making any or all of those dice rolls. For each individual dice that is being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can select 1 Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool to be substituted in place of that dice. The dice that it is being substituted for is not rolled, and instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled. Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll any remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:<br><ul><li><a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance">Advance roll</a></li><li><a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">Charge roll</a></li><li><a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">Hit roll</a></li><li><a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">Wound roll</a></li><li><a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw">Saving throw</a></li><li>Damage roll</li><li><a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests">Morale test</a></li></ul>A Miracle dice is not a modifier or an inherently modified dice (so, for example, if you use a Miracle dice with a value of 1 for a Morale test, that is considered to be an unmodified roll of 1). A Miracle dice that has been used for a substitution can never be re-rolled. This means that if any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Re-rolls">re-rolls</a> occur, the number and values of any Miracle dice that have already been substituted in the dice roll remain the same for the re-roll (for example, if a single Miracle dice was used to substitute one of the values of a charge roll, and the charge roll was re-rolled, only the unsubstituted dice can be re-rolled).<br><br><i><b>Example 1:</b> Instead of rolling one D6 to see what value is added to a unit’s Move characteristic when that unit <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance">Advances</a>, you could use a dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 5, you would add 5" to the Move characteristic of every model in that unit for that <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> Instead of rolling 2D6 to see what a unit’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">charge distance</a> is when making a charge roll, you could use either one or two dice from your Miracle dice pool.

Then roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other time the drill on this model has been activated during the battle. If the total is less than 6, the Seismic Tremors result below takes effect.
