2|VORTEX TERRORS|QT|Chaos Knights|Down from the tortured skies rushes a howling empyric gale thick with tortured souls and screeching avian gheists. They whirl about the foe in an ephemeral storm that sows terror and confusion amongst the enemy ranks.|Warp Storm Discipline|<b>Malediction:</b> <i>Vortex Terrors</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 5.

3|THE STORM MALEVOLENT|QT|Chaos Knights|Drawn forth by words of dark power, a storm from the depths of the warp surges up against the skin of reality. Its lashing tendrils tear the veil until corrupting energies spill through to taint all they touch. Trapped amidst this maelstrom of cursed unreality, the enemy are left horribly exposed to attack, and may even be driven back through the pulsating warp rent to suffer a horrible fate.|Warp Storm Discipline|<b>Malediction:</b> <i>The Storm Malevolent</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 7.

4|CYCLONIC LAMENTATION|QT|Chaos Knights|Spectral winds sing through the rents and channels in the Chaos Knights armour, their fury building as they meld with the rising shriek of its infernal plasma reactor. In an instant, the nightmare cacophony melds into a single tormented note that rolls outward like a shock wave, shredding the souls of all who hear it.|Warp Storm Discipline|<b>Witchfire:</b> <i>Cyclonic Lamentation</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 6. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, every enemy unit within 12" of this <span class="kwb">PSYKER</span> must take a <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-knights/#Dread-Tests">Dread test</a>. Each unit that fails this test suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> (if the result of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">Psychic test</a> was 11+, each unit that fails their subsequent Dread test instead suffers D3 mortal wounds).|000007239005|
5|CORUSCATING HATE|QT|Chaos Knights|So potent is the caster’s loathing of the foe that it manifests as roiling thunderheads amidst the darkened skies above. One after another, shrieking bolts of heliotropic lightning stab down from on high to explode amidst the enemy. Those struck are twisted by the raw power of the warp, their bodies erupting into grotesque mutations or burning with unholy soulfires until they are naught but ashes.|Warp Storm Discipline|<b>Witchfire:</b> <i>Coruscating Hate</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 6. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, the closest enemy unit within 18" of and visible to this <span class="kwb">PSYKER</span> suffers D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>. Then roll one D6: on a 2-3, the closest other enemy unit within 6" of and visible to that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound; on a 4+, it suffers D3 mortal wounds.|000007239006|
6|SPITESQUALL|QT|Chaos Knights|Viscous black rain is driven into the enemy upon howling and hateful winds. Bad enough that this bitter precipitation is freezing cold and blinding as it hisses viciously from armour and flesh, but as it drenches its victims’ bodies so too does it numb them and, eventually, drowns their souls.|Warp Storm Discipline|<b>Malediction:</b> <i>Spitesquall</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 6.

The unit’s Spitesquall tally is reset to 0 at the end of each phase.</li></ul>|000007239007|
